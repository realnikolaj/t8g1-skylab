# Determining "high-significance" nodes in a network of legal documents indicatingÂ one or more key obstacles for law makers implementing new laws during a pandemic.
Influenced by the corona pandemic, Danish lawmakers made amendments to existing laws and created new laws. By evaluating common links between all new laws containing "pandemic" keywords we seek to establish the one most relevant document for the creation of future laws. Although highly accessible, the Danish law may not be easily understood by everyone. Subjecting the documents to impartial and unbiased computer algorithms we seek to establish a logical chain of links and establish significant areas of importance in the Danish body of law.
