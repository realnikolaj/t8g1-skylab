## Unbound 
I want to implement an Unbound DNS in a container. Unbound is a 
recursive DNS resolver, which has the benefits of increasing online 
privacy. Furthermore, a user can encrypt communication because it 
supports DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS and unbound also makes sure 
that the data which is exchanged to the authoritative servers are 
limited. All this makes the DNS stronger which help to improve privacy. 
We want to use unbound because it is one of the best ways to secure a 
DNS server.
