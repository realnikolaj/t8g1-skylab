## Docker worker node
>Hugo task service


## Jira Container
In my personal vm i want to set up a jira container
Since we want to be a hosting, deployment and infrastructure service, it would be essential to have a tool to help us with managing our projects. Jira is basically a ticket managing software, which will help us delegate work and help us with bug tracking.
To set it up it will be as simple as to use the jiras docker image (I hope)
