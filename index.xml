4. 5. Docker or lxd for our server, and why? We have chosen to go for docker on our server. There are a couple reasons for that. Our server is rather simple, we are hosting a website using Hugo, which already has an official docker container. So it seemed like a no-brainer. lxd has many advanced features that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be utilized in out setup, therefore i makes sense to use a more userfriendly and still powerful tool like docker.</description></item><item><title>VM@Emin</title><link>https://realnikolaj.github.io/t8g1-skylab/emin-vm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realnikolaj.github.io/t8g1-skylab/emin-vm/</guid><description>Unbound I want to implement an Unbound DNS in a container. Unbound is a recursive DNS resolver, which has the benefits of increasing online privacy. Furthermore, a user can encrypt communication because it supports DNS-over-HTTPS and DNS-over-TLS and unbound also makes sure that the data which is exchanged to the authoritative servers are limited. All this makes the DNS stronger which help to improve privacy. We want to use unbound because it is one of the best ways to secure a DNS server.</description></item><item><title>VM@Group</title><link>https://realnikolaj.github.io/t8g1-skylab/group-vm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realnikolaj.github.io/t8g1-skylab/group-vm/</guid><description>Group VM Squid 1. Installing Docker and moving squid into docker: Installing docker on our group vm requires carefull considerations regarding the security measure already implemented. If a rootless docker principle is not established on the docker host, any container running will have root privileges which isn&amp;rsquo;t really an issue for veteran sysadmins that knows have to restrict access to the docker daemon using aswell firewall or custom docker registries to allow only vetted and verified container images to run, but in the hands of non-experienced employee a non-rootless docker client will run any code within any docker image.</description></item><item><title>VM@Nikolaj</title><link>https://realnikolaj.github.io/t8g1-skylab/nikolaj-vm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realnikolaj.github.io/t8g1-skylab/nikolaj-vm/</guid><description>Security Our reasonably hardened firewall doesn&amp;rsquo;t cover mitm attacks such as rouge services or containers, but by utilizing docker clients extensive nework measure and implementing the same overriding rule on each individual client running docker, we can lock back down all routes and isntead utilize the custom t8g1-ingress network created by a managing node such as Group VM or Nikolaj VM. Having two or more, managing nodes is highly recomend for fault taularance in case of e.</description></item><item><title>VM@Saif</title><link>https://realnikolaj.github.io/t8g1-skylab/saif-vm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://realnikolaj.github.io/t8g1-skylab/saif-vm/</guid><description>Docker worker node Hugo task service
Jira Container In my personal vm i want to set up a jira container Since we want to be a hosting, deployment and infrastructure service, it would be essential to have a tool to help us with managing our projects. Jira is basically a ticket managing software, which will help us delegate work and help us with bug tracking. To set it up it will be as simple as to use the jiras docker image (I hope)</description></item></channel></rss>
